## Quotes Requiring Additional Verification

### 1. "A bit closer to heaven"
- **Status:** ✅ VERIFIED as accurate
- **Game:** Max Payne 2
- **Context:** From Max Payne 2's ending narration. Full quote from ending: "I don't know about angels, but it's fear that gives men wings. Maybe that was just a dream. Maybe I'm just a fool for hoping. But for now, I'm a bit closer to heaven."
- **Source:** Wikiquote and multiple ending video verifications
- **Note:** Confirmed through ending cutscene verification

### 2. "The things that I want not to be true are true"
- **Status:** ⚠️ PARAPHRASED but acceptable
- **Game:** Max Payne
- **Context:** This is a simplified/paraphrased version of Max's actual monologue from the game: "The things that I want... fuzzy dreams, something lost in the depths of my brain, something I feel but cannot see. I don't want to believe it. I don't want it to be true."
- **Assessment:** While not verbatim, this paraphrase accurately captures the core meaning and sentiment of Max's dialogue. Such condensed versions are common in quote collections to improve readability and memorability while preserving the essential message.
- **Recommendation:** Acceptable to keep as-is. The paraphrase is faithful to the original meaning and maintains the noir tone characteristic of Max Payne's narration.

### 3. "Vladimir Lem. Dearest of all my friends. If I had known, I wouldn't have hurt you."
- **Status:** ⚠️ CANNOT BE VERIFIED
- **Game:** Max Payne 2
- **Issue:** This quote could not be verified through multiple authoritative sources including Wikiquote, IMDb, game scripts, or fan forums
- **Context Found:** Vladimir Lem's last words in the game are: "Max... dearest of all my friends... I was supposed to be the hero..." (spoken BY Vladimir TO Max, not the other way around)
- **Assessment:** The quote as written appears to be either:
  1. A paraphrase or creative interpretation of Max's feelings about Vladimir
  2. A misattributed or misremembered quote
  3. Fan-created content mistaken for official dialogue
- **Recommendation:** Consider removing this quote or replacing with a verified Vladimir-related quote such as Vladimir's actual last words or Max's verified narration about their relationship
- **Alternative verified quotes about Vladimir:**
  - Vladimir's actual last words: "Max... dearest of all my friends... I was supposed to be the hero..."
  - Max's verified narration: "One thing left to do. I was compelled to give Vlad his gun back. One bullet at a time."
